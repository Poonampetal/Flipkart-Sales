Project Title: E-Commerce Sales Performance Analysis Using SQL
<br>
Objective:
<br>
This project aims to analyze and optimize the sales performance of an e-commerce platform using SQL. The focus is on extracting key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, sales growth, top-selling products, regional sales distribution, and customer segmentation to enable data-driven decision-making.
<br>
Tools & Technologies Used: 
<br>
SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server) for querying and analyzing sales data.
<br>
Key Features & Analysis:
<br>
1️⃣ Total Sales Revenue: Calculates the overall revenue generated by the platform using SUM(TotalSales).
<br>
2️⃣ Sales Growth Percentage: Compares month-over-month revenue using LAG() and ROUND() functions to measure sales trends.
<br>
3️⃣ Top-Selling Products: Identifies the highest-selling products using SUM(Quantity) and ORDER BY TotalUnitsSold DESC.
<br>
4️⃣ Sales by Region: Analyzes revenue distribution across different regions using GROUP BY Region.
<br>
5️⃣ Customer Segmentation: Classifies customers into High, Medium, and Low-value segments based on total spending using CASE statements.
<br>
Impact: By leveraging SQL for sales analysis, this project provides valuable insights into customer behavior, regional performance, and product demand trends, helping stakeholders make data-driven business decisions.
